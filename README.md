# Implementation-of-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-and-compute-accuracy-by-jupyter-notebook.
* Definition:-
    * Naive-Bayes-Classifier is supervised machine learning that uses labelled data and which is used to solved classification and regression problem.
     
    * Naive:- It is called naive because it makes the assumption that all attributes are independent of each other'
    * Bayes:- It is called Bayes because it depends on the principle of Bayes' Theorem.
    * Bayes' Theorem:Bayes' theorem is also known as Bayes' Rule or Bayes' law, which is used to determine the probability of a hypothesis with prior knowledge. It depends on the conditional probability
    * The formula for Bayes' theorem is given as
    * P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
    * Where:
    * P(A|B) is the probability of A given B.
    * P(B|A) is the probability of B given A.
    * P(A) is the prior probability of A.
    * P(B) is the prior probability of B.
 * Working :-
    * Step 1:- Select the data-set
