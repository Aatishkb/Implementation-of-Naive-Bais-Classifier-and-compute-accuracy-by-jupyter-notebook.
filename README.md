# Implementation-of-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-and-compute-accuracy-by-jupyter-notebook.
* Definition:-
    * Naive-Bayes-Classifier is supervised machine learning that uses labelled data and which is used to solved classification and regression problem.
    * Naive:- It is called naive because it makes the assumption that all attributes are independent of each other'
    * Bayes:- It is called Bayes because it depends on the principle of Bayes' Theorem.
* Bayes' Theorem:
Bayes' theorem is also known as Bayes' Rule or Bayes' law, which is used to determine the probability of a hypothesis with prior knowledge. It depends on the conditional probability.
The formula for Bayes' theorem is given as:
Na√Øve Bayes Classifier Algorithm
Where,
P(A|B) is Posterior probability: Probability of hypothesis A on the observed event B.
P(B|A) is Likelihood probability: Probability of the evidence given that the probability of a hypothesis is true.
P(A) is Prior Probability: Probability of hypothesis before observing the evidence.
P(B) is Marginal Probability: Probability of Evidence.
